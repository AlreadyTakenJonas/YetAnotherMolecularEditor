# *JAMEd* - *Y*et *A*nothere *M*olecular *Ed*itor
This project developes a tool to create and manipulate 3D representations of molecules. The goal is to implement 
+ a graphical user interface, 
+ symmetry detection, symmetry operations, 
+ creating and deleting atoms and bonds, 
+ handling of mutliple molecules in the same file/window,
+ reading and writing, xyz, turbomole format, and other common formats like pdb or so,
+ reading and writing a custom file format to recreate a model with all its settings,
+ geometry minimisation,
+ fixing selected atom positions and
+ measureing distance, angles and dieder angles.
